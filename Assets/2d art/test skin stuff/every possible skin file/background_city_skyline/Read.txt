  Hi! I'm FÃ¡bio.


 I make these files available to you so that you can use them without having to credit me as an author. 
If you still have any doubts about licenses, I make this content available in the public domain (CC0). 
Feel free to use them for good projects. 



 If you want more assets, try looking for "FabinhoSC" on opengamearts.org, which can find some more of my work there.



 Anyway, my email:
